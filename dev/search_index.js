The volume of the sets is estimated using volume_heuristic. If the program is infeasible, the certificates for each transition are stored in infeasibility_certificates. For the containment of non-homogeneous, the S-procedure might be a Bilinear Matrix Inequality (BMI) which is NP-hard to solve. To avoid that, provides the value of λ to use in the dictionary λ. To ignore some state and the transitions involving these states in the computation, give an enabled vector without them.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"invariant/#SwitchOnSafety.invariant_sets!","page":"Invariant Sets","title":"SwitchOnSafety.invariant_sets!","text":"invariant_sets!(sets, modes_to_compute, system::AbstractHybridSystem,\n                args...; kwargs...)\n\nSimilar to invariant_sets(system, args...; kwargs...) but stores the result in sets and only compute the modes in modes_to_compute.
